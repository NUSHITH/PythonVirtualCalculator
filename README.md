✨Python Virtual Calculator with Hand Detection:

This project is a virtual calculator built using Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe. The calculator allows users to interact with buttons displayed on a video feed captured by their webcam. The buttons are rendered on the screen, and hand detection is used to simulate pressing these buttons. The project uses computer vision techniques to detect hand movements and perform basic arithmetic operations.

✨Key Features:

1)Real-time hand detection: Detects hands in the webcam feed and tracks finger movements.
2)Virtual button interaction: Simulates button presses on the screen using hand gestures.
3)Basic arithmetic operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

✨Packages Used:

1)OpenCV (cv2): Used for capturing video from the webcam, drawing buttons, and displaying text on the screen.
2)Mediapipe: Used for real-time hand detection and tracking, allowing interaction with virtual buttons based on finger movements.
3)Time: Used to introduce a brief delay after a button press to prevent multiple clicks from a single gesture.
